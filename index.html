              I am Big Data Developer at Orange. I am a very ambitious person who has set goals and consistently pursues them. In my job I mainly use SQL and technologies releated with releations databases. This job gives me a lot of satisfaction because I think that data explain many things. I am a graduate of the Warsaw University of Technology in the field of Mechanics of Vehicles and Machines. Since I graduated from this studies, programming is one of my interests. I am a graduate of postgraduate studies at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in the field of Big Data Engineering. I am currently attending master studies at the Collegium Humanum in the field of Management. In addition to studying at the university, I expand my skills through online courses and books. I like learning about new technologies, in particular I'm interested in Data Science, Big Data, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence using Python and technologies related to the construction of Web Applications using Java. I am open to acquiring new skills and if I encounter problems, I draw conclusions from them and learn from them, because then I know what to work on and what to improve. In my free time, I learn to make websites using technologies such as HTML, CSS and animating with JavaScript. I am also intersted in technologies and UI/UX solutions, which allows me to design websites betters. I am still working on my own projects and projects in the job to consolidate already acquired skills and learn new technologies.

        <h2>Boston Housing Price Prediction</h2>
        <p>A project concerning the prediction of housing prices, which I carried out for the purposes of one of the tasks at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. My goal was to create an algorithm based on the prediction of home prices in Boston, so as to invest money well. The project was written in Python and made in Jupyter Notebook. The main libraries I used in this project are pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, xgboost and many more. The data I used for this project comes from Kaggle. The built-in algorithm was based on linear regression, lasso and xgboost models.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="myprojects">
        <h2>Assignment of users in the dating app</h2>
        <p>The project concerns the creation of a Machine Learning model, which I carried out for the needs of one of the tasks at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. The aim of this project was to create an algorithm based on the appropriate number of clusters and assign users of the dating application to these clusters. The data that was used was taken from Kaggle. To build this model, I used libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib. Thanks to that, introducing this algorithm to the application will enable more accurate selection of people, thanks to which the application will work better and users will spend more time on it.</p>

      <div class="myprojects">
        <h2>Sea disaster analysis based on the Titanic</h2>
        <p>This is my first project that I carried out for one of the tasks at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. This project was based on data analysis and drawing conclusions regarding and answering the question of how to increase safety in sea expeditions. I created a Machine Learning model based on a decision tree that learned from training data and assigned labels so that it could predict new events. I used libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn in it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="myprojects">
        <h2>Data analysis relating to emergency calls</h2>
        <p>The project concerns the analysis of emergency telephone data in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, USA. The data used was taken from Kaggle and includes data from 2015. The main aim of the analysis was to present a heat map from which many conclusions can be drawn to minimize the number of such reports in the future. I believe the analysis has identified several issues that may help increase security. The possibilities offered by data analysis in Python are huge. To carry out this analysis, I used libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.</p>

      <div class="myprojects">
        <h2>Automated algorithm</h2>
        <p>The project was carried out for one of the tasks at the Warsaw University of Technology. My goal was to create a tool that would be as optimized as possible, speed up the calculation process and give the opportunity to make changes at any time. The sheet I created is used to calculate the entire project. I made this project in Microsoft Excel, I did it on my own initiative to facilitate the calculations. During the implementation of this project, I paid special attention to the fact that the supported spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel was as clear and easy to use as possible.</p>

              I love exploring new places and meeting people because it allows me to develop even faster and gain new experiences. I like to talk about all topics because then I can find out the other person's motivations. In addition to programming, I have many other interests that I develop on a daily basis. One of them is chess, board games and puzzle solving which allows me to relax. I also like to cook, bake cakes and play guitar, it gives me great pleasure.

              I like spending time actively, one of my activities that I have been practicing for a long time is cycling, rollerblading and skating. Whenever I have time, running and walking allow me to rest from work. I like reading books, especially by authors such as Stephen King, Juwal Noach Harari and Natalia Hatalska. My favorite artist is Taco Hemingway, I believe that each of his albums is different and describes different situations in it that he experienced throughout his life. I also like very much to listen to Artic Monkeys, Hurts, The Weekend, Sanah and Quebonafide. My favorite movies are Skazany na Shawshenk, 2001 A Space Odyssey and Django. My favorite series that I could still watch are Game of Thrones, Stranger Things and House of Cards. My favorite game series are The Witcher, Uncharted and Super Mario for the way they present the narrative, mechanics and world construction. Getting to know the culture enables me to look at the world more broadly, which causes me to discover new solutions in life situations.

              I chose the path of my career (programmer and working with data) because I believe that there is and will be more and more data, which causes an increase in demand and development of these technologies. Programming, on the other hand, allows me to think abstractly, which increases the possibilities of solving encountered problems. In addition, learning programming and data related technologies gives me great joy. At work, I like to listen to and watch podcasts, especially Imponderabilia, because it broadens my interests and I can learn something new.

              Warsaw is a city that you can still discover. I like the most districts such as Wola, Śródmieście and Wilanów. The city offers many opportunities and I really like the diversity of culture there and getting to know places that broaden my perception of the world. My favorite place in Warsaw is Plac Europejski due to its characteristic place and the events organized there. In my free time, I like to take pictures, especially of characteristic places and buildings in Warsaw.
